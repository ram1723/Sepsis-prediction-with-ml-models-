🩺 SEPSIS Prediction and Data Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the onset of Sepsis using patient vitals and clinical data through various machine learning algorithms. The notebooks contain both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, helping in early detection and prevention strategies.

📁 Project Structure
SEPSIS.ipynb – Implements machine learning models for early prediction of sepsis.

Analysis.ipynb – Performs data exploration and visualization to understand feature distributions and relationships.

📌 Problem Statement
Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. Timely detection is crucial for reducing mortality. In this project, we use patient data to:

Analyze important indicators

Build predictive models to identify sepsis-prone individuals

🧠 Techniques Used
Analysis.ipynb:
Data cleaning (NaN handling, null counts)

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Distribution plots (Temperature, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, etc.)

Correlation matrix to detect multicollinearity

Sepsis case distribution

Feature trends over time

SEPSIS.ipynb:
Data preprocessing

Model building using:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines

K-Nearest Neighbors

Model evaluation:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve

📊 Dataset Summary
Features: Age, Gender, Heart Rate, Temperature, O2 Saturation, and other clinical metrics

Target: SepsisLabel (0 - No Sepsis, 1 - Sepsis)

Preprocessing: Handled missing values and normalized input features

✅ Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	~0.89	High	High	High
Decision Tree	~0.86	High	Medium	Medium
Random Forest	~0.90	High	High	High
SVM	~0.87	High	Medium	Medium
KNN	~0.85	Medium	Medium	Medium

Random Forest performed best in most metrics and showed robustness in both precision and recall.
